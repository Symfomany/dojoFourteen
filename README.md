### Objectif: Playing With Lists/Arrays Series

Given an array of integers , Find the minimum sum which is obtained from summing each Two integers product .

### Contraintes

* Array/list will contain positives only .
* Array/list will always has even size

Examples:

```
    minSum(5,4,2,3) ==> return (22)
    // because 5*2 + 3*4 = 22
```

```
    minSum(12,6,10,26,3,24) ==> return (342)
    // because 3*26 + 6*24 + 10*12  = 342
```
